## 1. Understanding the Full-Stack Architecture
Our application consists of three main parts that work together:
-   **Blazor Server Frontend**: The user interface (UI) is built with Blazor components (`.razor` files). These components run on the server, and the browser receives UI updates over a real-time SignalR connection. This model provides a responsive user experience while keeping the UI logic on the server.
-   **ASP.NET Core Backend**: This is the engine of our application. It includes:
    -   **API Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests from the frontend or other clients.
    -   **Services**: Contain the core business logic, separating it from the UI and data access layers.
    -   **Data Access Layer**: Uses Entity Framework (EF) Core to communicate with the database.
-   **SQL Server Database**: The database stores all the application data, such as products, categories, and users.

This layered architecture makes the application scalable, maintainable, and easier to test.

---

## 2. Project Setup and Tooling

**Prerequisites:**
*   Visual Studio 2022 with the **ASP.NET and web development** workload.
*   **.NET 9 SDK** (or the latest version).
*   **SQL Server Express LocalDB** (usually installed with Visual Studio) or another SQL Server instance.

This tutorial assumes you have a Blazor Server project with ASP.NET Core Identity for authentication already created.

---

## 3. Database Design and Configuration

### Step 1: The Connection String
The connection string tells your application how to connect to the database. It's stored in `appsettings.json`. For local development, you can use the `appsettings.Development.json` file to override settings.

```json
// appsettings.json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\'''mssqllocaldb;Database=BlazorTutorialDb;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
  },
  // ... other settings
}
```
-   `Server=(localdb)\'''mssqllocaldb`: Connects to the local SQL Server instance.
-   `Database=BlazorTutorialDb`: The name of the database to create.
-   `Trusted_Connection=True`: Uses Windows authentication to connect.

### Step 2: Database Migrations
Migrations are how we manage the database schema. When you change your data models, you create a migration to apply those changes to the database.

1.  **Open Package Manager Console** in Visual Studio (`View` > `Other Windows` > `Package Manager Console`).
2.  **Create a Migration**:
    ```powershell
    Add-Migration InitialCreate
    ```
    This command inspects your models and creates a C# script that describes the necessary database changes.
3.  **Apply the Migration**:
    ```powershell
    Update-Database
    ```
    This command executes the migration script to create or update your database tables.

---

## 4. Models and Entity Framework Core

### Step 1: Defining Entity Models
Entities are C# classes that map to your database tables. We use data annotations to define rules for our data.

```csharp
// Models/Category.cs
public class Category
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    [Required]
    [StringLength(50)]
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public ICollection<Product> Products { get; set; } = new List<Product>();
}

// Models/Product.cs
public class Product
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    [Required]
    [StringLength(100)]
    public string Name { get; set; }
    [Column(TypeName = "decimal(18, 2)")]
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
    public int CategoryId { get; set; }
    public Category? Category { get; set; }
}
```
-   `[Required]`: Ensures the property cannot be null.
-   `[StringLength(50)]`: Sets the maximum string length.
-   `ICollection<Product>`: Defines a one-to-many relationship between `Category` and `Product`.

### Step 2: Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
DTOs are used to shape the data sent to and from the API. This prevents issues like over-posting and decouples your API from your database schema.

```csharp
// Models/ProductDto.cs
public class ProductDto
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    [Required]
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
    public int CategoryId { get; set; }
}
```

### Step 3: The Database Context
The `DbContext` represents a session with the database and allows you to query and save data.

```csharp
// Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs
public class ApplicationDbContext : IdentityDbContext
{
    public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options) : base(options) { }

    public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Category> Categories { get; set; }
}
```

---

## 5. Building the Services Layer
The service layer acts as a bridge between the API controllers and the data access layer.

### Step 1: The Product Service
The `ProductService` uses `HttpClient` to communicate with our backend API.

```csharp
// Services/ProductService.cs
public class ProductService
{
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;

    public ProductService(HttpClient httpClient)
    {
        _httpClient = httpClient;
    }

    public async Task<List<Product>> GetProductsAsync()
    {
        return await _httpClient.GetFromJsonAsync<List<Product>>("api/products");
    }

    public async Task<Product> GetProductByIdAsync(int id)
    {
        return await _httpClient.GetFromJsonAsync<Product>($"api/products/{id}");
    }

    public async Task CreateProductAsync(ProductDto product)
    {
        await _httpClient.PostAsJsonAsync("api/products", product);
    }

    public async Task UpdateProductAsync(int id, ProductDto product)
    {
        await _httpClient.PutAsJsonAsync($"api/products/{id}", product);
    }

    public async Task DeleteProductAsync(int id)
    {
        await _httpClient.DeleteAsync($"api/products/{id}");
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Service Registration
Register the service and `HttpClient` in `Program.cs` for dependency injection.

```csharp
// Program.cs
builder.Services.AddScoped(sp => new HttpClient { BaseAddress = new Uri(builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress) });
builder.Services.AddScoped<ProductService>();
```

## 6. Creating API Controllers
API controllers handle incoming HTTP requests and use the `DbContext` to perform database operations.

```csharp
// Controllers/ProductsController.cs
[Route("api/[controller]")]
[ApiController]
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;

    public ProductsController(ApplicationDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    // GET: api/products
    [HttpGet]
    public async Task<ActionResult<IEnumerable<Product>>> GetProducts()
    {
        return await _context.Products.Include(p => p.Category).ToListAsync();
    }

    // GET: api/products/5
    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public async Task<ActionResult<Product>> GetProduct(int id)
    {
        var product = await _context.Products.Include(p => p.Category).FirstOrDefaultAsync(p => p.Id == id);
        if (product == null) return NotFound();
        return product;
    }

    // POST: api/products
    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<ActionResult<Product>> PostProduct(ProductDto productDto)
    {
        var product = new Product
        {
            Name = productDto.Name,
            Price = productDto.Price,
            CategoryId = productDto.CategoryId
        };
        _context.Products.Add(product);
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
        return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetProduct), new { id = product.Id }, product);
    }

    // PUT: api/products/5
    [HttpPut("{id}")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> PutProduct(int id, ProductDto productDto)
    {
        if (id != productDto.Id) return BadRequest();
        var product = await _context.Products.FindAsync(id);
        if (product == null) return NotFound();

        product.Name = productDto.Name;
        product.Price = productDto.Price;
        product.CategoryId = productDto.CategoryId;

        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
        return NoContent();
    }

    // DELETE: api/products/5
    [HttpDelete("{id}")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> DeleteProduct(int id)
    {
        var product = await _context.Products.FindAsync(id);
        if (product == null) return NotFound();
        _context.Products.Remove(product);
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
        return NoContent();
    }
}
```

## 7. Building Interactive Blazor Components
This is where we build the UI. The `Products.razor` page will allow users to view, add, edit, and delete products.

*(A full implementation with MudBlazor is shown in the next section for a richer UI.)*

---

## 8. Integrating the MudBlazor Component Library
MudBlazor helps us build a professional-looking UI quickly.

1.  **Install Package**:
    ```powershell
    dotnet add package MudBlazor
    ```
2.  **Configure Project**: Follow the [MudBlazor installation guide](https://mudblazor.com/getting-started/installation) to add the necessary `@using` statements, CSS/JS links, and service registrations.

3.  **Implement the Products Page with MudBlazor**:
    Replace the content of `Pages/Products.razor` with a `MudTable` to display the data grid. This provides sorting, filtering, and a built-in modal for editing.

    *(A full code example for a CRUD data grid would be too long for this overview, but the MudBlazor documentation has excellent examples of how to build one.)*

---

## 9. Implementing Authentication and Authorization
ASP.NET Core Identity provides a robust system for managing users.

-   **Securing APIs**: Add the `[Authorize]` attribute to your API controllers to protect them from unauthorized access.
    ```csharp
    [Authorize]
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    public class ProductsController : ControllerBase { ... }
    ```
-   **Securing Blazor Pages**: Add the `@attribute [Authorize]` directive at the top of any `.razor` page to require login.
-   **Role-Based Security**: Use roles (e.g., "Admin", "User") to control access to specific features.
    ```csharp
    [Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> DeleteProduct(int id) { ... }
    ```

---

## 10. Running and Debugging the Application
-   **Run from Visual Studio**: Press **F5** to start the application with the debugger attached. You can set breakpoints in your C# code (both backend and frontend) to inspect variables and step through the logic.
-   **Run from CLI**:
    ```powershell
    dotnet watch run
    ```
    The `watch` command will automatically rebuild and restart the application when you save a file.

---

## 11. Testing Your API Endpoints
-   **Swagger (OpenAPI)**: Your project is pre-configured with Swagger, which provides an interactive UI to test your API. Run your application and navigate to `/swagger` to see all your endpoints and test them directly from the browser.
-   **Postman**: For more advanced testing, use a tool like Postman to create and save a collection of requests to your API, allowing you to test different scenarios and check performance.

---

## 12. Deployment to the Cloud
Deploying your application makes it accessible to the world. Azure App Service is a great option for ASP.NET Core applications.

1.  **Right-click** your project in Visual Studio and select **Publish**.
2.  Choose **Azure** as the target and select **Azure App Service (Windows)**.
3.  Follow the wizard to create a new App Service instance and a SQL Database in Azure.
4.  Visual Studio will handle the process of packaging and deploying your application and database to the cloud.

---

## 13. Development Best Practices
-   **Async Everywhere**: Use `async` and `await` for all database and network operations to keep your application responsive.
-   **Repository Pattern**: For larger applications, consider using the repository pattern to further abstract data access logic.
-   **Logging**: Implement structured logging (e.g., with Serilog) to record important events and errors.
-   **Global Error Handling**: Set up global error handling to catch unhandled exceptions and provide a consistent error response.

---

## 14. Common Issues and Troubleshooting
-   **CORS Errors**: If your frontend and backend are on different domains, you'll need to configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in `Program.cs`.
-   **Database Connection Problems**: Verify your connection string is correct and that the database server is accessible.
-   **Null Reference Exceptions in Blazor**: This often happens when data is not yet loaded. Use null checks (`@if (data != null)`) in your Razor components to prevent rendering before the data is ready.
